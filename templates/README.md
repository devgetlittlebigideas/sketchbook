# Component Templates

This directory contains example component templates to help you understand the expected structure and patterns for Sketchbook components.

## Templates

### 1. Simple Component (`simple-component.tsx`)
A basic component with minimal props. Great for:
- Labels, Badges, Tags
- Static containers
- Simple display components

**Features:**
- Basic props interface
- Simple className composition
- No complex variants

---

### 2. Component with Variants (`component-with-variants.tsx`)
A component with multiple visual variants and sizes. Great for:
- Buttons
- Alerts, Notifications
- Cards with different styles

**Features:**
- Variant system (primary, secondary, etc.)
- Size variants (sm, md, lg)
- Organized Tailwind classes
- Default prop values

---

### 3. Component with Sub-components (`component-with-subcomponents.tsx`)
A complex component with child components for composition. Great for:
- Modals, Dialogs
- Cards with Header/Body/Footer
- Accordion, Tabs
- Form Groups

**Features:**
- Main parent component
- Multiple sub-components
- Flexible composition
- Context sharing (if needed)

---

## How to Use These Templates

### 1. Choose the Right Template

Pick the template that best matches your component's complexity:

- **Simple?** Start with `simple-component.tsx`
- **Has variants?** Use `component-with-variants.tsx`
- **Has sections/parts?** Use `component-with-subcomponents.tsx`

### 2. Copy the Structure

Don't copy-paste directly! Instead:
- Read through the template
- Understand the pattern
- Apply the pattern to your generated code

### 3. Adapt to Your Needs

Every component is unique. Use templates as guides, not rigid rules:
- Add props specific to your component
- Adjust variants to match your design
- Include accessibility features relevant to your component
